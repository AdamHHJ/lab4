create a 2-activity application along with a
custom adapter. Your application will allow a user to select a color from a Spinner on one activity, and
once selected, launch the second activity and set the background of the new activityâ€™s layout to the
selected color. Once completed, you will add an icon to your application and generate a signed APK
that is ready to be distributed.
